        <CONCEPT>3&#039; end/5&#039; end</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A nucleic acid strand is inherently directional, and the &amp;quot;5 prime end&amp;quot; has a free hydroxyl (or phosphate) on a 5&#039; carbon and the &amp;quot;3 prime end&amp;quot; has a free hydroxyl (or phosphate) on a 3&#039; carbon (carbon atoms in the sugar ring are numbered from 1&#039; to 5&#039;). That&#039;s simple enough for an RNA strand or for single-stranded (ss) DNA. However, for double-stranded (ds) DNA it&#039;s not so obvious - each strand has a 5&#039; end and a 3&#039; end, and the 5&#039; end of one strand is paired with the 3&#039; end of the other strand (it is &amp;quot;antiparallel&amp;quot;). One would talk about the 5&#039; end of ds DNA only if there was some reason to emphasize one strand over the other - for example if one strand is the sense strand of a gene. In that case, the orientation of the sense strand establishes the direction </DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>3&#039; flanking region</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A region of DNA which is NOT copied into the mature mRNA, but which is present adjacent to 3&#039; end of the gene. It was originally thought that the 3&#039; flanking DNA was not transcribed at all, but it was discovered to be transcribed into RNA, but quickly removed during processing of the primary transcript to form the mature mRNA. The 3&#039; flanking region often contains sequences which affect the formation of the 3&#039; end of the message. It may also contain enhancers or other sites to which proteins may bind.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>3&#039; untranslated region</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A region of the DNA which IS transcribed into mRNA and becomes the 3&#039; end or the message, but which does not contain protein coding sequence. Everything between the stop codon and the polyA tail is considered to be 3&#039; untranslated. The 3&#039; untranslated region may affect the translation efficiency of the mRNA or the stability of the mRNA. It also has sequences which are required for the addition of the poly(A) tail to the message (including one known as the &amp;quot;hexanucleotide&amp;quot;, AAUAAA).</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION> A region of a gene which IS transcribed into mRNA, becoming the 5&#039; end of the message, but which does not contain protein coding sequence. The 5&#039;-untranslated region is the portion of the DNA starting from the cap site and extending to the base just before the ATG translation initiation codon. While not itself translated, this region may have sequences which alter the translation efficiency of the mRNA, or which affect the stability of the mRNA.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Antibiotic resistance</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION> Plasmids generally contain genes which confer on the host bacterium the ability to survive a given antibiotic. If the plasmid pBluescript, for example, is present in a host, that host will not be killed by (moderate levels of) ampicillin. By using plasmids containing antibiotic resistance genes, the researcher can kill off all the bacteria which have not taken up his plasmid, thus ensuring that the plasmid will be propagated as the surviving cells divide.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>ATG or AUG</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>The codon for methionine; the translation initiation codon. Usually, protein translation can only start at a methionine codon (although this codon may be found elsewhere within the protein sequence as well). In eukaryotic DNA, the sequence is ATG; in RNA it is AUG. Usually, the first AUG in the mRNA is the point at which translation starts, and an open reading frame follows - i.e. the nucleotides taken three at a time will code for the amino acids of the protein, and a stop codon will be found only when the protein coding region is complete.</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION> Bacterial Artificial Chromosome — a cloning vector capable of carrying between 100 and 300 kilobases of target sequence. They are propagated as a mini-chromosome in a bacterial host. The size of the typical BAC is ideal for use as an intermediate in large-scale genome sequencing projects. Entire genomes can be cloned into BAC libraries, and entire BAC clones can be shotgun-sequenced fairly rapidly.</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION>A virus which infects &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; , and which is often used in molecular genetics experiments as a vector, or cloning vehicle. Recombinant phages can be made in which certain non-essential &lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt; DNA is removed and replaced with the DNA of interest. The phage can accommodate a DNA &amp;quot;insert&amp;quot; of about 15-20 kb. Replication of that virus will thus replicate the investigator&#039;s DNA. One would use phage &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt; rather than a plasmid if the desired piece of DNA is rather large.&lt;/font&gt;</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Blotting</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A technique for detecting one RNA within a mixture of RNAs (a Northern blot) or one type of DNA within a mixture of DNAs (a Southern blot). A blot can prove whether that one species of RNA or DNA is present, how much is there, and its approximate size. Basically, blotting involves gel electrophoresis, transfer to a blotting membrane (typically nitrocellulose or activated nylon), and incubating with a probe which is often radioactive. Exposing the membrane to X-ray film (using a radioactive probe) produces darkening at a spot correlating with the position of the DNA or RNA of interest. The darker the spot, the more nucleic acid was present there.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>CAT assay</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION> 
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;An enzyme assay. CAT stands for chloramphenicol acetyl transferase, a bacterial enzyme which inactivates chloramphenicol by acetylating it. CAT assays are often performed to test the function of a promoter. The gene coding for CAT is linked onto a promoter (transcription control region) from another gene, and the construct is &amp;quot;transfected&amp;quot; into cultured cells. The amount of CAT enzyme produced is taken to indicate the transcriptional activity of the promoter (relative to other promoters which must be tested in parallel). It is easier to perform a CAT assay than it is to do a Northern blot, so CAT assays were a common method for testing the effects of sequence changes on promoter function. Largely supplanted by the reporter gene luciferase.&lt;/p&gt;</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>cDNA clone: &quot;complementary DNA&quot;</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A piece of DNA copied from an mRNA. The term &amp;quot;clone&amp;quot; indicates that this cDNA has been spliced into a plasmid or other vector in order to propagate it. A cDNA clone may contain DNA copies of such typical mRNA regions as coding sequence, 5&#039;-untranslated region, 3&#039; untranslated region or poly(A) tail. No introns will be present, nor any promoter sequences (or other 5&#039; or 3&#039; flanking regions). A &amp;quot;full-length&amp;quot; cDNA clone is one which contains all of the mRNA sequence from nucleotide #1 through to the poly(A) tail. </DEFINITION>

Introns are not coding sequences; nor are the 5&#039; or 3&#039; untranslated regions (or the flanking regions, for that matter - they are not even transcribed into mRNA). The coding sequence in a cDNA or mature mRNA includes everything from the AUG (or ATG) initiation codon through to the stop codon, inclusive.</DEFINITION>

The sequence of codons in the mRNA unambiguously defines the primary structure of the final protein. Of course, the codons in the mRNA were also present in the genomic DNA, but the sequence may be interrupted by introns.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Enhancer</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION> An enhancer is a nucleotide sequence to which transcription factor(s) bind, and which increases the transcription of a gene. It is NOT part of a promoter; the basic difference being that an enhancer can be moved around anywhere in the general vicinity of the gene (within several thousand nucleotides on either side or even within an intron), and it will still function. It can even be clipped out and spliced back in backwards, and will still operate. A promoter, on the other hand, is position- and orientation-dependent. Some enhancers are &amp;quot;conditional&amp;quot; - in other words, they enhance transcription only under certain conditions, for example in the presence of a hormone.</DEFINITION>

Mammalian genes do not function in bacteria, so to get bacterial expression from your mammalian cDNA, you would place its coding region (i.e. no introns) immediately adjacent to bacterial transcription/translation control sequences. That artificial construct (the &amp;quot;expression clone&amp;quot;) will produce a pseudo-mammalian protein if put back into bacteria. Often, that protein can be recognized by antibodies raised against the authentic mammalian protein, and vice versa.&lt;/font&gt;</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION>A method to analyze the size of DNA (or RNA) fragments. In the presence of an electric field, larger fragments of DNA move through a gel slower than smaller ones. If a sample contains fragments at four different discrete sizes, those four size classes will, when subjected to electrophoresis, all migrate in groups, producing four migrating &amp;quot;bands&amp;quot;. Usually, these are visualized by soaking the gel in a dye (ethidium bromide or SyberSafe) which makes the DNA fluoresce under UV light.</DEFINITION>

When a radiolabeled DNA fragment is run on a gel, it shows a characteristic mobility. If it is first incubated with a cellular extract of proteins (or with purified protein), any protein-DNA complexes will migrate slower than the naked DNA - a shifted band.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Hybridization</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>The reaction by which the pairing of complementary strands of nucleic acid occurs. DNA is usually double-stranded, and when the strands are separated they will re-hybridize under the appropriate conditions. Hybrids can form between DNA-DNA, DNA-RNA or RNA-RNA. They can form between a short strand and a long strand containing a region complementary to the short one. Imperfect hybrids can also form, but the more imperfect they are, the less stable they will be (and the less likely to form). To &amp;quot;anneal&amp;quot; two strands is the same as to &amp;quot;hybridize&amp;quot; them.</DEFINITION>

The vector sequences are those regions necessary for propagation, antibiotic resistance, and all those mundane functions necessary for useful cloning. In contrast, however, the insert is the piece of DNA in which you are really interested.</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION>Introns are portions of genomic DNA which ARE transcribed (and thus present in the primary transcript) but which are later spliced out. They thus are not present in the mature mRNA. Note that although the 3&#039; flanking region is often transcribed, it is removed by endonucleolytic cleavage and not by splicing. It is not an intron.</DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION>A technique for deleting, mutating or otherwise inactivating a gene in a mouse. This laborious method involves transfecting a crippled gene into cultured embryonic stem cells, searching through the thousands of resulting clones for one in which the crippled gene exactly replaced the normal one (by homologous recombination), and inserting that cell back into a mouse blastocyst. The resulting mouse will be chimaeric but, if you are lucky (and if you&#039;ve gotten this far, you obviously are), its germ cells will carry the deleted gene. A few rounds of careful breeding can then produce progeny in which both copies of the gene are inactivated.</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Library</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A library might be either a genomic library, or a cDNA library. In either case, the library is just a tube carrying a mixture of thousands of different clones - bacteria or &lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt; phages. Each clone carries an &amp;quot;insert&amp;quot; - the cloned DNA.
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A &lt;u&gt;cDNA library&lt;/u&gt; is usually just a mixture of bacteria, where each bacteria carries a different plasmid. Inserted into the plasmids (one per plasmid) are thousands of different pieces of cDNA (each typ. 500-5000 bp) copied from some source of mRNA, for example, total liver mRNA. The basic idea is that if you have a large enough number of different liver-derived cDNAs carried in those bacteria, there is a 99% probability that a cDNA copy of any given liver mRNA exists somewhere in the tube. The real trick is to find the one you want out of that mess - a process called screening (see &amp;quot;Screening&amp;quot;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;A &lt;u&gt;genomic library&lt;/u&gt; is similar in concept to a cDNA library, but differs in three major ways - 1) the library carries pieces of genomic DNA (and so contains introns and flanking regions, as well as coding and untranslated); 2) you need bacteriophage &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt;or cosmids, rather than plasmids, because... 3) the inserts are usually 5-15 kb long (in a &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt; library) or 20-40 kb (in a cosmid library). Therefore, a genomic library is most commonly a tube containing a mixture of &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Symbol&quot;&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt; phages. Enough different phages must be present in the library so that any given piece of DNA from the source genome has a 99% probability of being present.&lt;/font&gt;</DEFINITION>

There are two general types of polymerase — DNA polymerases (which synthesize DNA) and RNA polymerase (which makes RNA). Within these two classes, there are numerous sub-types of polymerase, depending on what type of nucleic acid can function as template and what type of nucleic acid is formed. A DNA-dependant DNA polymerase will copy one DNA strand starting from a primer, and the product will be the complementary DNA strand. A DNA-dependant RNA polymerase will use DNA as a template to synthesize an RNA strand.</DEFINITION>

By cycling the temperature, the target DNA is repetitively denatured and copied. A single copy of the target DNA, even if mixed in with other undesirable DNA, can be amplified to obtain billions of replicates. PCR can be used to amplify RNA sequences if they are first converted to DNA via reverse transcriptase. This two-phase procedure is known as ‘RT-PCR’. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is the basis for a number of extremely important methods in molecular biology. It can be used to detect and measure vanishingly small amounts of DNA and to create customized pieces of DNA. It has been applied to clinical diagnosis and therapy, to forensics and to vast numbers of research applications. </DEFINITION>

        <DEFINITION>When mRNA is translated by the cell, the nucleotides are read three at a time. By starting at different positions, the groupings of three that are produced can be entirely different. The following example shows a DNA sequence and the three reading frames in which it could be read. Not only is an entirely different amino acid sequence specified by the different reading frames, but two of the three frames have stop codons, and thus are not open reading frames (asterisks indicate a stop codon).&lt;font face=&quot;Monaco&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;A DNA open reading frame: &lt;p&gt; ...ATG ACA TGT AAA GAT AGA CTA ACC TTT TGG... ...Met Thr Cys Lys Asp Arg Leu Thr Phe Trp... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same bases, different &#039;frame&#039;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ...A TGA CAT GTA AAG ATA GAC TAA CCT TTT GG... ... *** His Val Lys Ile Asp *** Pro Phe Gly.. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Same sequence, the last of the 3 possible frames: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ...AT GAC ATG TAA AGA TAG ACT AAC CTT TTG G.. ... Asp Met *** Arg *** Thr Asn Leu Leu ... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;If we shift the grouping again, we will just get the first reading frame again. The reading frame that is actually used is determined by the first methionine codon (the initiation codon). Once that first AUG is recognized, the pattern of triplet groupings follows unambiguously. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Restriction enzyme</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>A class of enzymes (&amp;quot;restriction endonucleases&amp;quot;) generally isolated from bacteria, which are able to recognize and cut specific sequences (&amp;quot;restriction sites&amp;quot;) in DNA. For example, the restriction enzyme BamHI locates and cuts any occurrence of:&lt;font face=&quot;Monaco&quot; size=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt; 5&#039;-GGATCC-3&#039; |||||| 3&#039;-CCTAGG-5&#039; &lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=&quot;Helvetica&quot;&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Note that both strands contain the sequence GGATCC, but in antiparallel orientation. The recognition site is thus said to be palindromic, which is typical of restriction sites. Every copy of a plasmid is identical in sequence, so if BamHI cuts a particular circular plasmid at three sites producing three &amp;quot;restriction fragments&amp;quot;, then a million copies of that plasmid will produce those same restriction fragments a million times over. There are more than six hundred known restriction enzymes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bacteria produce restriction enzymes for protection against invasion by foreign DNA such as phages. The bacteria&#039;s own DNA is modified in such a way as to prevent it from being clipped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/font&gt;</DEFINITION>

        <CONCEPT>Screening</CONCEPT>
        <DEFINITION>To screen a library (see &amp;quot;Library&amp;quot;) is to select and isolate individual clones out of the mixture of clones. For example, if you needed a cDNA clone of the pituitary glycoprotein hormone alpha subunit, you would need to make (or buy) a pituitary cDNA library, then screen that library in order to detect and isolate those few bacteria carrying alpha subunit cDNA.
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;There are two methods of screening which are particularly worth describing: screening by hybridization, and screening by antibody. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Screening by &lt;u&gt;hybridization&lt;/u&gt; involves spreading the mixture of bacteria out on a dozen or so agar plates to grow several ten thousand isolated colonies. Membranes are laid onto each plate, and some of the bacteria from each colony stick, producing replicas of each colony in their original growth position. The membranes are lifted and the adherent bacteria are lysed, then hybridized to a radioactive piece of alpha DNA (the source of which is a story in itself - see &amp;quot;Probe&amp;quot;). When X-ray film is laid on the filter, only colonies carrying alpha sequences will &amp;quot;light up&amp;quot;. Their position on the membranes show where they grew on the original plates, so you now can go back to the original plate (where the remnants of the colonies are still alive), pick the colony off the plate and grow it up. You now have an unlimited source of alpha cDNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;Screening by &lt;u&gt;antibody&lt;/u&gt; is an option if the bacteria and plasmid are designed to express proteins from the cDNA inserts. The principle is similar to hybridization, in that you lift replica filters from bacterial plates, but then you use the antibody (perhaps generated after olde tyme protein purification rituals) to show which colony expresses the desired protein.&lt;/p&gt;</DEFINITION>

Since the cloned DNA may have been extensively modified (for example, protein binding sites on the promoter may have been altered or removed), this procedure is often used to test whether a particular modification affects the function of a gene</DEFINITION>
